## Frequently asked questions

1. What is the help widget?

The help widget allows you to embed a contact form or help articles in your website. To use the help widget, you need to create a Freshdesk account by [signing up here](https://freshdesk.com/signup?utm_source=wordpressplugin&utm_medium=pluginreadme). 

2. Where can I find the help widget code? 

Once you've logged in to your Freshdesk account, you can go to **Admin** > **Widgets** and create a new widget. You can click the 'Embed code' tab to copy the code from your Freshdesk account.

You can then paste it in the plugin settings page in WordPress. This will make the widget appear on all pages in your WordPress account.
